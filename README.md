# Christmas Sing a Song Kata

## Credits
Inspired by the original [Sing a Song Kata](https://kata-log.rocks/sing-a-song-kata).

## The "Situation"
Code to produce a popular Christmas song was produced by a web agency for the customer last year. 

The customer now desires to produce multiple different versions of the song using the same structure but based on different themes, for example a current popular children’s movie featuring a cast of animals. 

The customer asks that you make the song configurable for different lists of gifts.

The customer cannot guarantee that there will be the same number of days in each different version.

No documentation or tests were provided by the previous developer.
